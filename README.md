# EWT-Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention

This repository presents an **Optimized EWT-Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention Mechanism** model.

Two time-varying sequences are generated to evaluate a sequence-to-sequence learning (**Seq2Seq**) signal.

To extract features from the original signal, the empirical wavelet transform (**EWT**) is used.

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by **Optuna** and the **attention mechanism** is used.

The notebook for the analysis is divided according to the evaluations:

> Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention: _Evaluation of the starting model using the Attention Mechanism_.

> Optimized Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention: _Evaluation of the model with the optimized hyperparameters (based on Optuna)_.

> Standard Seq2Seq LSTM: _Standard model for comparative purposes_.
