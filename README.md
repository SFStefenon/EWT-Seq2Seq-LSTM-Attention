# EWT-Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention Mechanism

This repository presents a an Optimized EWT-Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention Mechanism model.

Two time-varying sequences are generated to evaluate a sequence-to-sequence learning (Seq2Seq) signal.

To extract features from the signal, the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is used.

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by Optuna and the attention mechanism is used.

The proposed analysis is divided according to the models evaluated:

Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention: Evaluation of the starting model using the Attention Mechanism.

Optimized Seq2Seq-LSTM with Attention: Evaluation of the model with the optimized hyperparameters (based on Optuna).

Standard Seq2Seq LSTM: Standard model for comparative purposes.
